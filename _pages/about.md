{% include about-picture-img.html %}

Before joining Oregon State, I received my MA and BS in mathematics at UC Santa Cruz. <!--[master's thesis](https://www.hse.ru/en/edu/vkr/296285338) -->

I am also passionate about mathematics pedagogy, and am committed to implementing inclusive and equitable teaching practices into my classrooms.
